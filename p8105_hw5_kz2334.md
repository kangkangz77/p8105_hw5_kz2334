Problem 1
---------

Load required packages

``` r
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```

Import file names to create a dataframe.

``` r
file_name = tibble(
  id = list.files("./data/")
)

file_name
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 x 1
    ##    id        
    ##    <chr>     
    ##  1 con_01.csv
    ##  2 con_02.csv
    ##  3 con_03.csv
    ##  4 con_04.csv
    ##  5 con_05.csv
    ##  6 con_06.csv
    ##  7 con_07.csv
    ##  8 con_08.csv
    ##  9 con_09.csv
    ## 10 con_10.csv
    ## 11 exp_01.csv
    ## 12 exp_02.csv
    ## 13 exp_03.csv
    ## 14 exp_04.csv
    ## 15 exp_05.csv
    ## 16 exp_06.csv
    ## 17 exp_07.csv
    ## 18 exp_08.csv
    ## 19 exp_09.csv
    ## 20 exp_10.csv

Read in data for each subject.

``` r
study_data = file_name %>% 
  mutate(infor = purrr::map(str_c("./data/", id), read_csv)) 
```
